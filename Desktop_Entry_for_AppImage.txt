file should be named as "filename.desktop"

the file should be placed in the "/usr/share/applications/filename.desktop" directory

the file should contain details like such::

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Bitwarden
Comment=FOSS Password Manager
GenericName=Password Manager
Exec=path_to_the_app_image
Icon=simply_name_the_application_name   #Icon appears if it is present in the system
Type=Application
StartupNotify=false  #Does not start automatically at the boot time 


save it and close

now to validate the file
type
$desktop-file-validate filename.desktop

If there are no errors you can view the application in the application menu.
